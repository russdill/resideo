# Resideo/Honeywell Water Heater Accessory Support

This repo is intended to document and support the accessory port of various
similar modules of water heater controllers. Its currently known to work with
the Resideo WV8840C but should also work with similar Resideo and Honeywell
models.

Support includes documenting the protocol in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) and
a ESPHome implementation.
